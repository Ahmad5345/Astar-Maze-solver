        "\n",
        "### Feature Representation: TF-IDF\n",
        "\n",
        "I used a TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) representation to convert raw email text into numerical features suitable for traditional machine learning classifiers. TF-IDF is well suited for spam classification because it emphasizes words that are frequent in a particular email but rare across the corpus, which aligns well with how spam often contains distinctive lexical markers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parameter choices and rationale:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `lowercase=True`\n",
        "  All text is lowercased to reduce sparsity caused by casing differences (e.g \"FREE\" vs \"free\"). This is a standard normalization step in text classification and helps traditional models generalize better.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `stop_words=english`\n",
        "  Common function words (e.g \"the\", \"and\", \"is\") carry little discriminative value for spam detection. Removing them reduces noise and dimensionality, improving both efficiency and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `ngram_range=(1, 2)`\n",
        "  I included both unigrams and bigrams. While single words capture basic lexical cues, bigrams allow the model to detect short spam phrases such as \"free money\", \"limited offer\", or \"click here\", which are highly informative for spam classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `min_df=2`\n",
        "  Tokens that appear in only one document are removed. These extremely rare terms are often typos, artifacts, or idiosyncratic content that do not generalize and can harm model robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `max_df=0.95`\n",
        "  Tokens that appear in more than 95 percent of documents are removed, since they provide little discriminative power and behave similarly to stop words.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `sublinear_tf=True`\n",
        "  Log-scaled term frequency reduces the dominance of very long emails and prevents raw token counts from overwhelming the model. This is particularly important because spam emails can be unusually repetitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `norm=l2`\n",
        "  L2 normalization ensures feature vectors have comparable magnitudes, which is especially important for linear models such as SVMs that rely on geometric margins.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classifier 1: Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
        "\n",
        "The first traditional baseline is **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, a probabilistic model that has historically performed well on text classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Justification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Naive Bayes assumes conditional independence between features, which is violated in natural language, but in practice it performs surprisingly well for bag-of-words and TF-IDF representations.\n",
        "* It is extremely fast to train and evaluate, making it a strong efficiency baseline.\n",
        "* Its probabilistic outputs are useful for threshold-based analysis and ensemble methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hyperparameters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `alpha=1.0`\n",
        "  This applies Laplace smoothing, preventing zero probabilities for unseen tokens at test time. This improves robustness, especially when encountering rare or novel spam patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classifier 2: Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
        "\n",
        "The second traditional classifier is a **linear SVM**, which is widely regarded as one of the strongest classical models for high-dimensional sparse text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Justification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Linear SVMs are well suited to TF-IDF features, where the number of dimensions can be very large.\n",
        "* The margin-based objective focuses on difficult boundary cases, which is important for minimizing false positives in spam detection.\n",
        "* Compared to Naive Bayes, SVMs typically achieve higher precision and F1 scores, at the cost of increased computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hyperparameters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `kernel='linear'`\n",
        "  A linear kernel is computationally efficient and appropriate for text data, where decision boundaries are often approximately linear in TF-IDF space.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `C=1.0`\n",
        "  This regularization strength balances margin maximization and classification error. A moderate default value was chosen to avoid overfitting while maintaining strong performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `probability=True`\n",
        "  Probability estimates were enabled to allow ROC-AUC evaluation and to support soft-voting in the ensemble model. Although this slightly increases training cost, it enables richer comparative analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preprocessing Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "No stemming or lemmatization was applied. While these techniques can reduce sparsity, they may also remove meaningful distinctions in spam-related language (e.g \"offer\" vs \"offering\"). Instead, the combination of TF-IDF weighting, n-grams, and document frequency thresholds provided a strong balance between expressiveness and generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the traditional ML pipeline was designed to be:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Interpretable**, through explicit feature weights and token-level analysis\n",
        "* **Efficient**, particularly in comparison to transformer-based models\n",
        "* **Strongly competitive**, serving as a meaningful baseline against which to evaluate neural and ensemble approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "These design choices ensured a fair, well-justified comparison between classical and modern methods in the later evaluation sections.\n"

        "### Model Choice\n",
        "\n",
        "I used DistilBERT (`distilbert-base-uncased`) as the neural classifier. DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT that retains much of BERT’s representational power while being significantly smaller and faster. This makes it a strong compromise between performance and computational cost for spam classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Training Procedure\n",
        "\n",
        "The model was fine-tuned end-to-end using Hugging Face’s `Trainer` API with the following configuration:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Learning rate:** `2e-5`\n",
        "  This learning rate is standard for fine-tuning transformer models. Lower learning rates help prevent catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained representations while still allowing task-specific adaptation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Number of epochs:** `3`\n",
        "  Three epochs provided sufficient convergence without overfitting. In preliminary experiments, increasing epochs did not yield meaningful validation gains and increased the risk of memorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Batch size:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Training: `16`\n",
        "  * Validation/Test: `16`\n",
        "    This batch size balances GPU memory constraints with gradient stability. It is commonly used for fine-tuning DistilBERT on medium-sized text datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Weight decay:** `0.01`\n",
        "  Applied to reduce overfitting by penalizing large weights, which is particularly important when fine-tuning large pre-trained models on smaller datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Optimizer and scheduling:**\n",
        "  The default AdamW optimizer and linear learning rate scheduling provided by the `Trainer` were used, as these are well-validated defaults for transformer fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Model selection:**\n",
        "  The best model was automatically selected based on **validation F1 score** using `load_best_model_at_end=True`. This ensures that the final model reflects the best generalization performance rather than the last training checkpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sequence Length Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "Email texts vary widely in length, from very short messages to long multi-paragraph emails. To handle this variability:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Maximum sequence length:** `256` tokens\n",
        "  This value captures most emails while keeping computation manageable. It represents a tradeoff between retaining context and avoiding excessive truncation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Truncation:**\n",
        "  Emails longer than 256 tokens were truncated from the end. This is reasonable for spam detection, since spam indicators typically appear early in the message (subject lines, calls to action, URLs).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Padding:**\n",
        "  Shorter sequences were padded to the maximum length using standard attention masks. Padding ensures uniform tensor shapes for efficient batching without influencing model predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Monitoring and Preventing Overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting was monitored using **validation metrics evaluated at the end of each epoch**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Metrics tracked:** accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score\n",
        "  F1 score was emphasized because it balances false positives and false negatives, which is critical in spam detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Training vs. validation behavior:**\n",
        "  Validation performance improved during early epochs and stabilized by epoch 3, while training performance continued to increase slightly. This pattern suggests that the model was learning meaningful generalizations without severe overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Early stopping via model selection:**\n",
        "  Although explicit early stopping was not enabled, selecting the best checkpoint based on validation F1 served a similar purpose by preventing degradation in generalization performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Regularization:**\n",
        "  Weight decay and limited epoch count further reduced the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "If additional time or data were available, explicit early stopping and learning curve visualization would provide even finer-grained control over overfitting.\n"

For each email, the ensemble computes the average of the three spam probabilities and applies a fixed 0.5 decision threshold to produce the final classification. This strategy was chosen because it preserves confidence information (unlike hard voting) and leverages complementary model strengths: traditional models capture surface-level lexical cues while the transformer captures contextual and semantic patterns. Averaging probabilities helps smooth over overconfident individual predictions and reduces correlated errors, providing a simple, transparent, and robust ensemble without the added complexity or overfitting risk of stacked meta-classifiers."

While DistilBERT attains the highest AUC (0.9998), the ensemble slightly sacrifices AUC in exchange for better balance between precision and recall, which is reflected in its superior F1 score and accuracy (0.9947). This indicates that the ensemble successfully leverages complementary strengths: traditional models contribute strong lexical sensitivity, while the transformer contributes contextual understanding, reducing edge-case errors. In short, the ensemble provides the best overall classification performance and the most balanced error profile, even though the gains are incremental due to near-ceiling performance of the individual models."

        "\n",
        "To analyze the failure modes of the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, I examined 20 misclassified test emails (10 false positives and 10 false negatives) and categorized them using heuristic pattern labels. The dominant error patterns reflect the model’s strong reliance on surface-level lexical statistics.\n",

        "### 1. Vocabulary Overlap Between Spam and Ham\n",
        "\n",
        "The most frequent error pattern for MNB is **Spam Trigger Words** (6 cases), followed by **Promotional Language** (3 cases). Many false positives correspond to legitimate newsletters or opt-in marketing communications that contain canonical spam vocabulary such as *free*, *gift*, *prize*, *certificate*, or large monetary amounts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples include branded newsletters (e.g iWon, e-Rewards, Network World) that clearly identify themselves as subscriptions and include unsubscribe instructions. However, because MNB models each word independently and relies on token frequency ratios, the presence of multiple high-likelihood spam tokens overwhelms contextual cues that indicate legitimacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:**\n",
        "MNB systematically overweights individual spam-associated tokens and cannot condition their meaning on surrounding context. As a result, legitimate promotional emails are often indistinguishable from spam at the lexical level.\n",

        "\n",
        "Several misclassifications (2 cases) involve **very short emails** consisting of only a subject line or a few words (e.g., “si is back up in folsom”). These messages provide insufficient evidence for reliable word-probability estimation.\n",

        "### 3. Unusual Formatting and Noise\n",
        "\n",
        "Some false negatives contain **non-standard formatting**, garbled text, or lists of semantically unrelated tokens (e.g biomedical or technical word clusters). These emails do not resemble the prototypical spam examples seen during training and therefore lack recognizable spam-associated vocabulary.\n",

        "To characterize the failure modes of the linear Support Vector Machine classifier, I analyzed 20 misclassified test emails (10 false positives and 10 false negatives) and grouped them into heuristic error patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Short or Low-Context Emails\n",
        "\n",
        "The most frequent error pattern for the SVM is **Short / Low Context** (6 cases). These messages contain extremely limited textual content, often consisting of only a subject line or a few tokens (e.g “tufco – prebid,” “si is back up,” “credit in 3 d – destruction testing”).\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the SVM decision function relies on a weighted sum of TF-IDF features, sparse vectors with very few active features provide insufficient evidence to confidently place the email on either side of the decision boundary. In such cases, even weakly weighted spam-associated features can dominate the classification.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "An equally frequent pattern is **Spam Trigger Words** (6 cases). Many false positives correspond to legitimate newsletters, subscription confirmations, or informational emails that include spam-associated tokens such as *free*, *credit*, *offer*, or monetary values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike Naive Bayes, the SVM does not independently accumulate word probabilities. However, strong positive weights on these tokens can still push the decision function toward the spam class when multiple such features co-occur, even if the overall discourse is legitimate.\n",

        "**Interpretation:**\n",
        "Although the SVM is more robust than Naive Bayes to isolated spam keywords, dense clusters of promotional terms can still overwhelm ham-indicative features.\n",

        "### 3. Promotional Language and Legitimate Subscriptions\n",
        "\n",
        "A smaller number of misclassifications (2 cases) involve **Promotional Language** in clearly opt-in or informational contexts (e.g welcome emails, woodworking subscription confirmations). These emails often resemble spam structurally but are legitimate.\n",

        "Linear models lack access to pragmatic cues that distinguish unsolicited spam from legitimate marketing communications.\n",

        "### 4. Unusual Formatting and Domain-Specific Content\n",
        "\n",
        "Several misclassified emails contain unusual formatting, historical records, or domain-specific narratives (e.g Masonic lodge history). These texts do not resemble either canonical spam or conversational ham and therefore activate a mixture of weakly informative features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:**\n",
        "The SVM is sensitive to distributional mismatch: when emails fall outside the lexical patterns seen during training, predictions become unreliable.\n",

        "### 5. False Negatives: Business-Style and Polite Spam\n",
        "\n",
        "Most **false negatives** involve spam written in a professional or polite tone, such as CRM software pitches, commercial service offerings, or referral-based outreach. These messages intentionally avoid aggressive spam vocabulary and instead mimic legitimate business correspondence.\n",

        "## Ensemble Error Pattern Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand the failure modes of the soft-voting ensemble, I analyzed 20 misclassified test emails (10 false positives and 10 false negatives) and categorized them using heuristic pattern labels. Several clear themes emerge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Vocabulary Overlap Between Spam and Ham\n",
        "\n",
        "A dominant source of **false positives** is substantial lexical overlap between legitimate emails and spam. Many misclassified ham messages resemble promotional or newsletter-style content, containing words such as *free*, *gift*, *prize*, *offer*, or monetary amounts. Examples include long newsletters from services like iWon or e-Rewards that are opt-in marketing communications but structurally indistinguishable from spam campaigns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though the ensemble combines contextual (DistilBERT) and lexical (TF-IDF) signals, strong agreement among models on these high-salience spam tokens pushes the averaged probability above the decision threshold. This shows that ensemble voting does not eliminate bias when **all component models are exposed to the same surface cues**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Takeaway:** The ensemble inherits shared lexical biases from its base models, particularly in cases where marketing language is legitimate but spam-like.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Short or Low-Context Emails\n",
        "\n",
        "The most frequent error pattern overall is **Short / Low Context** (5 cases). These emails contain minimal text, often just a subject line or a few words (e.g “si is back up in folsom,” “contact me asap”).\n",
        "\n",
        "Such messages lack enough semantic or lexical information for any model to confidently infer intent. In these cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "* TF-IDF models lack sufficient feature evidence.\n",
        "* DistilBERT lacks contextual structure to infer discourse-level meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, the ensemble’s averaged probabilities become unstable and sensitive to weak signals, leading to both false positives and false negatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Takeaway:** Ensembles do not compensate well for fundamentally ambiguous inputs; lack of context remains a hard failure case across modeling paradigms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Promotional Language in Legitimate Emails\n",
        "\n",
        "Some false positives are driven by **legitimate promotional or informational content**, such as newsletters, sweepstakes announcements, or corporate updates. These emails often include disclaimers, unsubscribe language, and brand names, which are typical of lawful marketing emails but also common in spam datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ensemble misclassifies these because:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Traditional models heavily weight promotional n-grams.\n",
        "* The transformer correctly interprets intent as informational, but its probability is diluted when averaged with TF-IDF models that are more confident.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Takeaway:** Averaging probabilities can sometimes suppress correct contextual judgments when other models are overconfident for lexical reasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Unusual Formatting and Forwarded Content\n",
        "\n",
        "Several false positives involve forwarded jokes, anecdotes, or informal email chains with unusual formatting, heavy quoting, or atypical punctuation. These deviate from standard conversational email structure and resemble noisy or mass-distributed messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "These cases illustrate a limitation of both traditional and neural approaches: **formatting irregularities can be mistaken for spam artifacts**, even when content is benign.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. False Negatives: Professional or Business-Like Spam\n",
        "\n",
        "Most **false negatives** correspond to spam messages written in a formal, professional tone (e.g CRM software pitches, debt recovery services, business referrals). These emails avoid overt spam trigger words and instead mimic legitimate business correspondence.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Do different models make different mistakes?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes. Although all models struggle with some common failure modes, their **error profiles differ in systematic ways**, reflecting their underlying representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Naive Bayes** errors are dominated by **Spam Trigger Words** and **Promotional Language**. This aligns with its independence assumption and reliance on token frequencies. Legitimate newsletters and opt-in marketing emails are frequently misclassified as spam when they contain canonical spam vocabulary.\n",
        "* **SVM** errors are split almost evenly between **Spam Trigger Words** and **Short / Low Context** emails. While more robust than Naive Bayes to individual keywords, the linear decision boundary becomes unstable when TF-IDF vectors are extremely sparse.\n",
        "* **DistilBERT** errors are most frequently driven by **Spam Trigger Words**, but for a different reason. Rather than isolated tokens, the model is misled when **promotional language is dense and repeated**, overwhelming contextual cues. DistilBERT makes fewer errors on short emails than SVM, but still struggles when semantic content is minimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "This confirms that the models do not fail identically and often make **complementary mistakes**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Are neural models better at certain types of spam than traditional models?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, but with important caveats.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **DistilBERT outperforms TF-IDF models on semantically rich emails**, especially when spam intent is implicit rather than keyword-driven. It is better at recognizing tone, discourse structure, and narrative flow.\n",
        "* However, DistilBERT is **more vulnerable to high-quality, professionally written spam** that mimics legitimate business communication. In these cases, semantic coherence actually works against the model, causing false negatives.\n",
        "* Traditional models, particularly Naive Bayes, are **better at detecting crude or noisy spam** that contains obvious trigger words, even when the text is poorly structured.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, neural models are not uniformly superior. They excel at contextual understanding but can be deceived by polished, low-pressure spam that avoids overt spam signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Where does the ensemble help most?\n",
        "\n",
        "The ensemble provides the greatest benefit in cases where **individual model errors are uncorrelated**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* DistilBERT and the ensemble disagree meaningfully, with **18 cases where the ensemble is correct and DistilBERT is wrong**, and only **12 cases in the reverse direction**. This indicates that lexical models often correct DistilBERT’s false negatives on promotional or business-style spam.\n",
        "* Conversely, DistilBERT helps correct false positives made by Naive Bayes and SVM on legitimate newsletters and informational emails.\n",
        "* The ensemble is especially effective on **borderline cases** involving mixed signals, where lexical cues and contextual cues point in different directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, the ensemble does not eliminate all errors. Cases involving **extremely short emails** or **severe vocabulary overlap between spam and ham** remain difficult for all models, as reflected by the ensemble’s dominant error pattern being **Short / Low Context**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overall Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Each model captures a different aspect of the spam detection problem:\n",

        "* Naive Bayes emphasizes lexical salience,\n",
        "* SVM balances sparse lexical evidence,\n",
        "* DistilBERT captures semantic and contextual structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ensemble improves robustness by combining these perspectives, reducing variance and compensating for individual weaknesses. However, it cannot fully resolve ambiguities that are inherent in the data itself, particularly when intent is underspecified or deliberately obfuscated.\n",

        "#### Multinomial Naive Bayes (TF-IDF)\n",
        "\n",
        "For Naive Bayes, feature importance is derived from the learned log-probabilities of tokens conditioned on each class. Tokens with high log-probability under the spam class represent strong spam indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most predictive **spam-associated features** include lexical markers such as:\n",

        "* *money*, *free*, *click*, *http*, *www*, *online*, *email*, *com*\n",

        "This confirms that Naive Bayes relies heavily on **surface-level lexical statistics** and treats individual tokens as independent signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Linear SVM (TF-IDF)\n",
        "\n",
        "For the linear SVM, feature importance is determined by the magnitude and sign of learned coefficients. Positive coefficients push predictions toward spam, while negative coefficients push toward ham.\n",
        "\n",
        "Highly weighted features include numeric tokens such as *“00”*, which appear frequently in both spam (e.g. prices, monetary amounts) and ham (e.g. years, identifiers). These tokens often lie near the decision boundary and receive large-magnitude coefficients due to their high frequency and discriminative ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "This highlights a known property of linear TF-IDF models: **frequent numeric or formatting-related tokens can become disproportionately influential**, even when they lack semantic meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the SVM captures stronger decision boundaries than Naive Bayes but remains sensitive to **lexical frequency artifacts**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### DistilBERT (Transformer)\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike traditional models, DistilBERT does not assign global importance weights to tokens. Instead, interpretability is assessed using **token-level attention**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Attention visualization on misclassified emails shows that DistilBERT focuses heavily on:\n",

        "* subject-line tokens\n",
        "* numbers\n",
        "* formatting markers\n",
        "* promotional phrases and URLs\n",
        "\n",
        "This indicates that the model attends to **structurally salient regions** of emails rather than isolated keywords. However, attention patterns also reveal that dense promotional language can dominate contextual cues, explaining false positives on legitimate newsletters and false negatives on professionally written spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Ensemble Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The soft-voting ensemble has no intrinsic feature representation. Its behavior is interpreted by decomposing predictions into its component models.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Adversarial Example Design\n",
        "\n",
        "I manually crafted five adversarial emails designed to resemble realistic spam evasion strategies used in the wild. These examples target known weaknesses of text classifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Character substitution** (e.g *Fr33*, *V1agra*, *cl1ck*) to evade keyword-based filters.\n",
        "2. **Benign content injection**, where legitimate workplace language (meeting notes, greetings, signatures) is mixed with spam intent.\n",
        "3. **Obfuscated URLs** (e.g *hxxp://*, *[dot]*) commonly used to bypass URL detectors.\n",
        "4. **Phishing-style account warnings** written in a professional, non-aggressive tone.\n",
        "5. **Mixed casing and spacing**, which disrupt surface-level lexical patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "All five adversarial emails should be classified as spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Adversarial Classification Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Across the five adversarial emails, **all models (Naive Bayes, SVM, DistilBERT, and the ensemble)** correctly classified 4 out of 5 examples as spam. The only exception was the **benign content injection example**, which all models classified as ham.\n",
        "\n",
        "This failure case is informative rather than problematic: the injected legitimate context (“Hi team”, “meeting notes”, “Best, John”) successfully masks spam intent for *every* model. This demonstrates that adversarial content injection remains a difficult challenge even for contextual transformers and ensembles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model robustness summary (manual adversarial examples):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Naive Bayes**: Vulnerable to content injection but robust to obfuscation and casing tricks.\n",
        "* **SVM**: Similar behavior to Naive Bayes, with slightly stronger resistance to noisy formatting.\n",
        "* **DistilBERT**: Strong against obfuscation and character substitution, but still fooled by realistic benign context.\n",
        "* **Ensemble**: Matches the strongest behavior of individual models but cannot overcome adversarial examples that fool all components simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Robustness Analysis Under Input Perturbations\n",
        "\n",
        "To systematically evaluate robustness, I applied three classes of perturbations to the adversarial emails and measured average spam probabilities across models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Case Randomization\n",
        "\n",
        "Random capitalization had **minimal effect** on all models. This is expected because:\n",
        "\n",
        "* TF-IDF vectorization lowercases input by default.\n",
        "* DistilBERT is pretrained on mixed-case text and robust to casing variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "All models maintained relatively high spam probabilities, indicating strong robustness to this attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Synonym Replacement\n",
        "\n",
        "Synonym replacement produced **nearly identical results** to case randomization. This suggests that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The synonym replacement was relatively mild.\n",
        "* Core spam semantics (e.g., urgency, reward, action requests) were preserved.\n",
        "* Both lexical and contextual cues remained intact.\n",
        "\n",
        "DistilBERT and the ensemble showed the highest stability, indicating robustness to moderate paraphrasing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Typos and Misspellings\n",
        "\n",
        "Typos caused the **largest divergence in model behavior**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Naive Bayes and SVM** showed noticeable drops in average spam probability, reflecting their dependence on exact token matches.\n",
        "* **DistilBERT** was highly robust, assigning near-certain spam probabilities even under heavy character corruption.\n",
        "* **The ensemble remained stable**, benefiting from DistilBERT’s robustness while smoothing over the degraded confidence of lexical models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This confirms that transformer-based models are substantially more robust to character-level noise due to subword tokenization and contextual embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Comparative Robustness Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Most robust overall**: **DistilBERT**, especially against typos and obfuscation.\n",
        "* **Most fragile**: **Naive Bayes**, due to strict lexical dependence.\n",
        "* **Best practical tradeoff**: **Ensemble**, which inherits robustness from DistilBERT while retaining sensitivity to lexical spam cues.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Takeaway\n",
        "\n",
        "Adversarial testing reveals that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Simple obfuscation (typos, casing, character substitution) is largely ineffective against modern models.\n",
        "* Context-aware transformers significantly improve robustness.\n",
        "* Ensembles improve average robustness but cannot overcome adversarial examples that exploit semantic ambiguity and pragmatic deception.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings emphasize that real-world spam detection requires not only strong text models, but also additional signals such as sender reputation, metadata, and behavioral patterns.\n"

        "The dataset used in this assignment is close to balanced across splits (approximately 52 percent spam, 48 percent ham in train, validation, and test sets). Because of this, no explicit imbalance correction (such as class weighting or resampling) was required during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, imbalance robustness was addressed implicitly through:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Stratified train/validation/test splits**, ensuring consistent class ratios across all subsets.\n",
        "* **Evaluation with F1 score and recall**, rather than accuracy alone, to ensure that performance was not dominated by the majority class.\n",
        "* **ROC-AUC analysis**, which is insensitive to class prevalence and reflects ranking quality rather than raw class frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "All models achieved very high and balanced precision and recall, indicating that class imbalance did not distort learning in this setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What happens if the spam/ham ratio changes in production?**\n",

        "* Recall becomes more critical.\n",
        "* Thresholds could be lowered to reduce false negatives.\n",
        "\n",

      "source": [
        "## Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates that modern spam classification is best understood as a tradeoff between **lexical sensitivity, contextual understanding, and computational efficiency**, rather than a simple progression from “old” to “new” models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional TF-IDF–based models remain remarkably strong. Both Multinomial Naive Bayes and the linear SVM achieved near-ceiling performance (F1 > 0.99), confirming that spam detection is still largely driven by **surface-level lexical cues** such as promotional phrases, URLs, and monetary indicators. The linear SVM consistently outperformed Naive Bayes in recall, indicating that margin-based optimization is better at capturing difficult boundary cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The transformer-based DistilBERT model achieved the highest single-model accuracy and AUC. Its strength lies in semantic and discourse-level understanding, allowing it to correctly classify emails where spam intent is implicit rather than keyword-driven. It was also substantially more robust to adversarial perturbations such as typos and obfuscation due to subword tokenization and contextual embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The best overall performance was achieved by the **soft-voting ensemble**, which combined lexical and contextual signals. The ensemble produced the highest F1 score and recall, and exhibited the most balanced error profile. Its gains were modest because individual models already performed extremely well, but error analysis showed that the ensemble corrected complementary mistakes made by its components. This confirms that ensemble methods are most valuable not for large accuracy jumps, but for improved robustness and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite strong performance, several limitations remain.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the dataset is relatively clean and well-labeled. Real-world email streams exhibit significant domain shift, evolving spam tactics, and changing class priors. Models trained on static datasets may degrade over time without continual updating.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, the classifiers rely exclusively on email text content. In practice, spam detection systems incorporate metadata such as sender reputation, sending frequency, header anomalies, and user interaction signals. The absence of these features limits real-world applicability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, the ensemble uses simple probability averaging with a fixed decision threshold. While effective, this approach does not adapt to changing operating conditions or asymmetric costs of false positives versus false negatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, interpretability remains partial. Although feature weights and attention patterns provide insight, none of the models offer fully transparent explanations of intent or deception, especially in cases of high-quality, professional spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "With more time, several improvements would be explored:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dynamic threshold tuning based on deployment context.\n",
        "* Cost-sensitive learning to explicitly penalize false positives.\n",
        "* Incorporation of metadata and behavioral features.\n",
        "* More systematic adversarial training to improve robustness against content injection attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reflection\n",
        "\n",
        "The most challenging aspect of this assignment was going beyond raw metrics to understand *why* models fail. With performance near 99 percent, meaningful insights required careful error analysis rather than headline numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "One surprising result was how competitive traditional models remain. Despite the expressive power of transformers, TF-IDF models captured much of the signal needed for spam detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another notable insight was that DistilBERT occasionally failed on professionally written spam that mimicked legitimate business communication, while simpler lexical models correctly flagged these messages. This highlights an important tension between understanding language and detecting deceptive intent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the ensemble results reinforced a key lesson: improvements at high performance levels are incremental but meaningful. Even small reductions in error rates can translate into large practical gains at scale, especially when false positives carry high user cost."
